# Small JavaScript challenges

During semester 2 of ICT & Media I worked on 3 small JavaScript challenges. All the 3 challenges have a small function that does something with what you fill in the text box.

## Letter capitalized

The function I wrote for this challenge makes the first letter of each word a capitalized letter.

## Valid RGB color

This function checks if the RGB color filled in is a right RGB color and display what color it is.

## Word count

When typing in a sentence, the function calls how many words are used for you.
